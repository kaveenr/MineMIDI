# MineMidi
Minecraft is amazing, with redstone you can make anything you can dream of. I wanted to build some redstone creations for music but after some time the stock sounds didn't really work out. **What if Minecraft can output MIDI, therefore I can hook it up to my DAW full of plugins** That's exactly what MineMidi is.

## How to set it up?
1. Install MineMidi on your Spigot Server running locally.
2. Install a virtual MIDI driver like, [Midi Loop](http://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html)
3. Thats It folks, bind channels 2 -6 on your DAW and make some noise :)
